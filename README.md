# Soil Health & Agroecology â€“ Framework Review

This repository hosts code and reproducible R workflows to:
- parse framework PDFs,
- detect **proximity-based** co-occurrence between exact tokens (themes/synonyms),
- build tidy outputs (CSV), indicator matrices (Excel), and heatmaps,
- support a comparative review of soil health & agroecology frameworks.
